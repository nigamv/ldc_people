LDC people

1.0 Introduction

This project was begun in order to meet a class requirement for CIT597 - Programming Languages and Techniques III - which I took in fall 2014. The project was very open ended; the professor (Swapneel Sheth) wanted us to work with real data and ideally have an app that could be put to good use after the class was over. As such, my idea for the project developed over time and I eventually ended up with trying to fill a serious need at LDC; an annotation cost-tracking system to provide information primarily for expediting budget development and timeline estimates. However, as this is an ambitious goal and I was the only person working on this project, I thought I'd begin by just tracking part-time annotator time on tasks, using imformation from the timesheet system.

2.0 Status

I was able to create the PT database, import information from the Timesheet system (as a .csv), and produce a few calulations using the information. However, in the rush to add features before turning it in at the end of the semester, my testing got woefully behind and I introduced an odd bug that needs to be dealt with (the part timer form currently populates fields intentionally left blank with subsequent information - very weird and I haven't been able to find anything about it online yet). So there's lots more to be done here; oh to have more free time...
